# Introduction to C Language

C is a powerful and widely used programming language. It was developed by Dennis Ritchie in 1972 at Bell Labs. C is known for its speed, efficiency, and flexibility, making it popular for system programming, game development, and embedded systems.

# Why Learn C?
+ It is the foundation of many modern languages like C++, Java, and Python.
+ It is fast and efficient.
+ It allows low-level memory manipulation.
+ It is widely used in operating systems, databases, and embedded systems.
  
# Basic Features of C

+ Simple and structured.
+ Supports functions and modular programming.
+ Uses pointers for memory management.
+ Allows direct hardware interaction.

# Basic Structure of a C Program

Every C program follows a simple structure:
#include <stdio.h>

```c
int main() {
    printf("Hello, World!\n");
    return 0;
}
```
+ **#include <stdio.h>:** Includes the standard input/output library.

+ **int main():** The main function where execution starts.

+ **printf():** Prints output to the screen.

+ **return 0;:** Ends the program successfully.

# Conclusion

C is a great language to start programming because it teaches fundamental concepts that are useful in other languages. Learning C helps you understand how computers work at a lower level, making you a better programmer.
